# Video Audio Fade-Out Script

This script adds a fade-out audio effect to the end of a video using `moviepy`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- moviepy module

## Installation

Before running the script, install the `moviepy` module:

```bash
pip install moviepy
```

## Usage

The script applies a fade-out effect to the audio track of a video.

### Steps:

1. Replace `"your_video_path"` with the path to your video file.
2. Set `fade_out_duration` to the desired fade-out duration in seconds.
3. Replace `"your_output_path"` with the desired output file path.
4. Run the script to apply the fade-out effect and save the video.

## Functionality

- The script loads a video file and applies a fade-out effect to its audio track over a specified duration.
- It then saves the video with the updated audio track to a new file.

## Note

- Ensure you have the legal right to modify and use the video files you apply this effect to.
- The script requires the `moviepy` library, which should be installed and properly set up in your Python environment.
